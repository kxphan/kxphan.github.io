    I am a technologist and organizer striving to use technology to address inequity in sociopolitical systems. I was previously a <b>data scientist at Facebook</b>, where I worked on elections integrity, co-governance, well-being, memorialization, and suicide prevention. As a <b>computer science student at Stanford University</b> (B.S., 2017), I researched urban growth through computer vision and statistics.
    <p>
    My philosophy is that technology can function as a platform for addressing broken systems, but never a panacea. As such, my work is geared towards the advancement of ethical civic technology. In the near future, I will be joining <b>San Francisco's Office of Civic Engagement and Immigrant Affairs as the lead researcher</b> to tackle data disaggregation and langague access.<p>
    When I'm not reading (voraciously) or writing (a little less so), I organize with Southeast Asian American grassroots organizations. My advocacy, research, and technical work are inherently tied to my dedication to bringing equity and justice for immigrant and refugee communities. Please reach out if you are interested in connecting.
