  Currently working on language access with the <a href="https://sf.gov/departments/city-administrator/office-civic-engagement-and-immigrant-affairs">
    San Francisco Office of Civic Engagement and Immigrant Affairs</a>. I graduated
  with a BS in Computer Science from Stanford University and worked as a data scientist focusing on election integrity before
  switching to public administration and policy.<br><br>
  I grew up near the Puget Sound in Washington state and currently reside in San Francisco, where I spend a bit too much time
  browsing bookstores or running along Ocean Beach.<br><br>
  You can contact me primarily through email, though my other communication channels are also listed on this website.
